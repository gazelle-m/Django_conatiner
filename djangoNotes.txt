To start new django project in current directory
`django-admin startproject <project name> .`
    When running this code, 2 things will show up in navigation;
        A folder with the project name and a file called `manage.py`
            everything inside the folder is realted to the configuration of the project
            In this project, we will be using `urls.py` and `settings.py`

To run the new project we use the command
`python3 manage.py runserver`
# Warning in red would show up, that is expected

To start a new app, use the following command
`django-admin startapp home`
This will created a new folder with the app dependencies

To run the new app we need to add to our INSTALLED_APPS variable inside the project settigns file
In our case it's called, decisions.settigns

TO add the first function in the app, we script our function in the app's view.py

To make templates for the app, we make a new folder inseide the app directory, we call it "Templates"
We also make another folder inside "templates" with the app's name 

This uses DTL (Django template language) to handle the render freamwork of html


 Modularisation:
 To make the apps inside the porject modular, we create urls.py inside each app with similar entities to the one in the porjects orginal "urls.py"
 In the orginal urls.py we import the "include" function beside the path function form django.urls
